## Notebook Summary: Reinforcement Learning for Financial Trading

This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a reinforcement learning-based trading strategy using a Transformer model and the Gymnasium framework (maintained fork of the OpenAI Gym framework). 

**At a basic level, the notebook does the following:**

1. **Sets up the environment:** Installs necessary libraries (`stable-baselines3`, `shimmy`) and checks for GPU availability.
2. **Loads and preprocesses financial data:** Reads historical market data from a CSV file, scales numerical features, and engineers features for the model. The data is then split into training and testing sets.
3. **Defines a Transformer model:** Creates a custom Transformer model architecture specifically designed for financial trading. This model will learn to predict buy/sell signals based on market data patterns.
4. **Defines a trading environment:** Sets up a simulated trading environment using OpenAI Gym, allowing the agent to interact with the market and receive rewards based on its trading decisions.
5. **Trains a PPO agent:** Trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent within the trading environment. The agent learns by interacting with the environment and adjusting its actions to maximize profits.
6. **Tests the trained agent:** Loads the trained agent and tests its performance in the simulated trading environment, evaluating its ability to make profitable trades.
7. **Displays the final results:** Shows the agent's final balance and the total number of trades executed during the test, providing an overall assessment of its trading strategy.

**In essence, this notebook aims to develop and evaluate a reinforcement learning-based trading agent that can learn to make profitable trading decisions based on historical market data.** The Transformer model is used to capture complex patterns in the data, and the PPO algorithm guides the agent's learning process. The simulated trading environment provides a safe and controlled setting for the agent to experiment and improve its strategy.
